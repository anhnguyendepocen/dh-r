# Introduction

## Multiply your ways of knowing

The best advice a historian ever gave me about historical methods was this: "Multiply your ways of knowing." That advice gets to the heart of how historians do their work. Historians are methodologically omnivorous. In their pursuit of understanding about the past, they are willing to consider any body of sources, and they are willing to apply any way of reading them that they can devise, so long as those sources and methods produce a new way of understanding the past. The history of the historical profession can in broad outlines be understood as a series of developments in how historians chose their sources and studied them. Political history was succeeded by social history was succeeded by cultural history, and in each instance historians paid attention to new sources and devised new ways of studying them. While of course there is much creative destruction as the findings of new methods invalidate some of the conclusions of the older methods, on the whole the historical discipline is on a sounder footing the more it multiplies the ways in which it can learn about the past.

Going back at least to the 1960s, and gaining new life in recent years, historians have used computation as a means of multiplying their ways of knowing about the past.^[@thomas_ii_computing_2004.]  Like other historical methods, once you have gained a familiarity with computational history, you will see historical sources in a new way. Let me give an example using some data that I gathered. The Paulist Fathers, an order of Catholic missionary priests, kept a *Chronicle* of their missions across the United States during the nineteenth century.^[*Chronicle of the Missions Given by the Congregation of Missionary Priests of St. Paul the Apostle*, six manuscript volumes, Paulist Fathers Archives, New York, NY.] These six manuscript volumes contain over a thousand pages of narrative recollections and anecdotes about the missions the Paulists preached. Any historian would know what to do with those narrative portions, though some historians might pay attention to social relations, others to the gendered aspects of the missions, and so on. 

At the head of each entry, though, the Paulists recorded statistics of the missions, as in the image below. It would be easy to ignore these statistics, or to mention the numbers for a mission here or a mission there without ever doing anything systematic with them.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The statistics for a Paulist mission held in Washington, DC, in 1889. Note the dates, location, number of confessions, and number of conversions."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paulist-chronicle.jpg")
```

Once transcribed these statistics, though scattered over a thousand pages, made a cohesive table of data, keeping track of the cities in which missions were held, their dates, the number of confessions the Paulists heard, and the number of converts they made. From there the locations mentioned in the Paulist chronicle could be geocoded, so that latitudes and longitudes were associated with place names. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The first few rows of a data table transcribed from the Paulist missions. Note that each piece of significant information from the manuscript record has become its own column in the table."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paulist-table.png")
```

With that table of data, it is possible to create many kinds of visualization. One might, for instance, check the relationship between the duration of the missions and the number of converts the Paulists made, or ask which states had the most converts. After also finding the data for the historic state boundaries and railroad locations, it is possible to create a map like the one below, in order to understand the spatial relationship of Paulist missions.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Redemptorist and Paulist missions from 1852 to 1865. Note that there are three kinds of spatial data in this map: the transcribed missions data with city locations, the historical state boundaries, and the railroad network."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paulist-map.png")
```

In this instance a prior knowledge of computational history let us see our sources differently. Latent in the manuscript *Chronicle* was a table of data. What might have been just a useful collection of anecdotal details *also* became a quantitative and spatial dataset which let us examine the larger patterns of Paulist missions. By multiplying our ways of knowing, we learned more about the Paulists than we otherwise would have. 

Once you are familiar with what you can do with these kinds of historical methods, you will start seeing many sources differently. The aim of this book is to teach you how to think historically with computational methods.

## What is computational history?

For the purposes of this book, **computational history** will mean analyzing and visualizing historical data via scripting in a computer programming language.^[This definition roughly aligns with the subject matter of other books on the topic, including @graham_exploring_2015; @arnold_humanities_2015; @afanador-llach_programming_2017; @jockers_text_2014.] For historians that kind of data analysis has most often meant spatial analysis, text analysis, and network analysis, though it could also include sound analysis and image analysis. Those broad domains share many analytical techniques in common. The patterns you learn for one will often apply to another.

Historical sources are treated as **data** when we look for larger patterns by studying them in the aggregate without the preliminary step of examining or reading the sources one by one. And of course treating sources as data usually implies that at some intermediate point in the process of analysis we treat them as numbers. For example, places might be reduced latitudes and longitudes, and texts might be reduced to tokens.

Though this work does not absolutely require computer programming, computer programming in a language with the libraries to support data analysis is the most effective and reliable means of doing such work. (This statement will be justified below.) While you could do some of the work described in this book with, say, Excel, this book will teach you the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).

Computational history is a particular kind of work one can do within the much larger domains of digital history or the digital humanities. For example, creating or using a content management system to manage historical sources is a kind of digital history but not computational history, but creating a visualization of the metadata in that content management system is computational history. What matters is not the specific action (computer programming) as the the kinds of sources and methods applied to them.

Computational history is most easily defined by giving examples of the kinds of things that one can do with it. Consider these few examples of historical sources and methods:

- Given lists of members of different organizations, you create a network graph of shared membership between organizations to reveal the social structure of a community.
- Given the WPA former slave narratives, you extract all of the places mentioned using natural-language processing, in order to create a spatial index and map of the narratives.
- Given all of the religious tracts published in the nineteenth century by the American Tract Society, you create a topic model of how the subjects of those tracts changed over time. You also create a word-embedded model to explore the relationship between words in the corpus.
- Given a set of price data, you create a chart of changing prices over time. You also create a function which can adjust prices for inflation to compare them over time.

## Why computational history?

Computational methods offers historians the same advantage of as any other historical method: a different way of seeing sources, and thus of interpreting the past. There a several specific ways in which computational history offers new angles of vision.

The most important is **scale**. Historians do their work at many different scales, from the individual life in biography, to the single event or community in microhistory, to the structural history over *la longue dur√©e* of the *Annales* School.^[For a recent call for a return to long-term history, see @guldi_history_2014.] Computational methods allow historians to examine many more sources than they could ever read, and so to uncover trends which they might not otherwise be able to see. In the *[Viral Texts](https://viraltexts.org/)* project, for example, scholars examined how nineteenth-century U.S. newspapers reprinted texts from one another in millions of newspapers. Any scholar with two newspapers could identify an example or two of reprinting, and a literary historian with a database some diligence in searching could probably recover the reprinting history of a single text. But it took computational methods for the *Viral Texts* team to uncover the large-scale patterns of reprinting.^[@cordell_reprinting_2015; @smith_computational_2015.]

Computational methods help historians not only at the large scale, but also at smaller scales.^[Cf. @graham_exploring_2015, pp. 1--2.] Once you have charted the macroscopic trends, you are free to use computational methods as a discovery tool for smaller scale analysis. For instance, having uncovered the networks of text borrowing, you can then read individual texts systematically because you are better informed about their relationship to one another. Computational history is not so much a replacement for traditional historical methods as it is a way of directing your attention when using those methods. And a key advantage of computational history is the ability to move back and forth between different scales of historical analysis.

Another advantage of computational methods is that they help historians not just to frame different questions, but to **frame questions differently**. Sometimes historians start by reading a body of sources, then draw up their questions on the basis of that reading. More often historians frame a historical question then go find the sources that can help them to answer it. Historians iterate back and forth between exploring sources and framing questions. 

Computational history is a way of encouraging that cycle by providing a check on the historian's imagination or prior knowledge. Consider an example of a project where a computational approach overturned my prior (and seemingly well founded) assumptions about a body of sources. For *America's Public Bible*, I wrote a program to count up how frequently Bible verses were quoted in nineteenth-century U.S. newspapers. Before seeing the results, I assumed that verses oftened used to support the idea of Christian nationalism would be among the most quoted. After all, religious historians have written a great deal about the origins of Christian nationalism in the United States, and newspapers were a logical place for those ideas to be advanced. With that knowledge, I could have framed a question about the role of those texts (e.g., 2 Chronicles 7:14; Proverbs 14:34; Psalm 33:12). And had I searched the *[Chronicling America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/)* collection of newspapers, I would have certainly found what I was looking for, because the search would have turned up what I already knew to look for.^[Cf. @putnam_transnational_2016.]

But when I computed how frequently every Bible verse was used, I found that those "Christian nationalist" verses were insignificant compared to many other texts: not only did they not appear in the top ten verses, they barely appeared in the top thousand verses. And on the other hand, I also could not have predicted what the most frequently used verses actually were. The most commonly used texts were "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not" (Luke 18:16; Matthew 19:14), because newspapers often published Sunday school lessons. The chart gives an idea of the difference in popularity between those Sunday school texts and the "Christian nationalist" texts.^[@mullen_americas_2016.]

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A comparison of the popularity of Luke 18:16 ("Suffer little children to come unto me ...") and 2 Chronicles 7:14 ("If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves ...") in nineteenth-century U.S. newspapers. From *America\'s Public Bible* <<http://americaspublicbible.org>>.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/public-bible-chart.png")
```

In other words, even for a period and topic on which I am supposedly an expert, I was unable frame a historical question that bore any reasonable relationship to the actual prevalence of biblical verses in U.S. newspapers. But the results of my computational analysis showed me which questions I needed to frame in a more rigorous way. Computational history can discipline the way that we frame our questions, by directing our attention to what was historically typical in a measured way. Historians are often quite brilliant at finding the perfect illustrative anecdote. Computational history is more prosaic, because it is better at uncovering the typical detail rather than the telling detail. Yet knowing what is typical and what is not is a crucial piece for keeping our interpretations of the past grounded in the sources and not driven to and fro by our own anachronistic assumptions.

As an aside, this kind of disciplined question framing is not a capitulation to positivism. Because computational historians often use measurements as evidence, they are sometimes accused of thinking that the only kind of evidence is measurements. For most computational historical work, that accusation is simply groundless. The key is that the measurements are often treated as questions rather than answers. To continue the example from above, "Luke 18:16" was not the definitive answer to the question. Rather the question became, "Why Luke 18:16 instead of 2 Chronicles 7:14?" This leaves ample room for humanistic question framing and answering, and no room at all for positivism.

Computational history also **makes sources legible** for study which would otherwise not be used. Quantitative sources almost by definition require some kind of computation, and historicans have been using those kinds of sources in a serious way since at least the 1960s. Sources like the U.S. Census or the records of membership in religious denominations become available to historians who are able to compute on them. To give another example, geographic data---or even just sources that mention places---can be opened up once one is able to make maps. Consider Cameron Blevin's approach to the region and imagined geographies in his [study of Houston newspapers](http://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=93). Blevins was able count up the places mentioned in those newspapers and then chart and map the frequency with which they were mentioned. Any historian could read those newspapers---though they would almost certainly skip over the advertisements or freight tables, which become legible to Blevins's approach---but it was computation and mapping which turned that raw data into something meaningful to a historian. ^[@blevins_space_2014; @blevins_mining_2014.] 

Finally, computational history can enable **presentations of historical arguments that are interactive and iterative**. Many of the methods discussed in this book lend themselves to visualization, and many of them all the historian to interact with this visualizations iteratively to explore data and come to better questions or fuller answers. While the focus of this book is not on creating interactive websites or novel forms of visualization, it will demonstrate how to take an interative approach to computational history, and these approaches can later be translated to interactive websites.

## How to learn computational historical thinking

At a a minimum, computational historical thinking requires competencies in certain kinds of approaches and problems. These can be enumerated fairly simply as analytical categories, such as text analysis, network analysis, mapping and spatial analysis, image and sound analysis. And it also includes various techniques of data analysis which apply broadly to each of these types of analysis, such as clustering data points or machine learning. Data visualization is an essential competency for a computational historian. And of course statistics is a discipline in its own right, from which computational historians borrow as necessary to do certain kinds of work. These kinds of approaches are not disconnected. For example one can use natural language processing to extract place names from texts, those place names can be mapped, but those places can also be treated as a network. So while these competencies can be learned independently, it is also necessary to understand how how they relate to one another. In practice, you are likely to use several of these methods in any given project.

Underlying those methods are a set of more basic skills for working with data. For historians, these skills are not objects of interest in themselves, but they are part of the craft of data analysis and are essential in that they enable you to work efficiently and correctly. Some of these skills include understanding the way that data is structured, knowing how to read it in to your programs, and how to transform it into a structure that you can work with. Perhaps the most common form of data is tabular, including databases and CSV files, but also matrices. But digital historians might also work with APIs for pulling down information; they might read in data that is stored as XML or JSON; they might have to scrape a website to import data which is not available in a machine-readable format; and they might need to deal with geospatial data. Another set of skills involves extracting certain kinds of meaning from data. For example, regular expressions are a widely used technique for pulling out pieces of textual data, such as names or dates. Parsing dates is another necessary technique. Increasingly, people who work with data are recognizing the importance of being able to reproduce the results of their analysis, so reproducible research is another important skill.

Yet far more important than these specific methods or skills at working with data is knowing how to use them in concert in the service of asking and answering historical questions. A pile of bricks is not a house. But a pile of bricks plus a trowel, mortar, and scaffolding is not a house either. In addition to materials and tools, one needs to know how to go about building the house, and also what kind of house one wants to build. To some extent this book is about how to find materials and use tools, but more importantly it is about how to build the house. In history that means knowing how to ask and answer historical questions.

## How this book is organized

Part I of this book aims to teach you how to think as a historian with computational methods. Each chapter is a miniature research project. Beginning with some historical dataset, each chapter demonstrates how to frame a meaningful historical question which can be answered by computation. They then walk you through the process of analyzing the data, visualizing it, asking further historical questions, and so on in an iterative process until you have come to a historical argument or interpretation. These chapters apply the methods explained in part II in order to show how those methods stand in relation to one another.

Part II teaches the methods of computational history themselves. These chapters break down into roughly two categories. Some chapters explain how to work with different types of data. For example, you will need to know how to read in tabular data and spatial data, but you will also need to know how to parse dates and names. Other chapters explain analytical techniques, such as mapping or network analysis. These chapters also point you to more in-depth explanations for further reading.

The appendices contain technical information that you may find useful, such as an explanation of how to install R and its packages and a guide to the package ecosystem in R. In general, this information is included because I have found in teaching that having it available it clears the path for students to focus on more meaningful concerns.
