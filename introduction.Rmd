# Introduction

The best advice a historian ever gave me about historical methods was this: "Multiply your ways of knowing." That advice gets to the heart of how historians do their work. Historians are methodologically omnivorous. In their pursuit of understanding about the past, they are willing to consider any body of sources, and they are willing to apply any way of reading them that they can devise, so long as those sources and methods produce a new way of understanding the past. The history of the historical profession can in broad outlines be understood as a series of developments in how historians chose their sources and studied them. Political history was succeeded by social history was succeeded by cultural history, and in each instance historians paid attention to new sources and devised new ways of studying them. While of course there is much creative destruction as the findings of new methods invalidate some of the conclusions of the older methods, on the whole the historical discipline is on a sounder footing the more it multiplies the ways in which it can learn about the past.

Going back at least to the 1960s, and gaining new life in recent years, historians have used computation as a means of multiplying their ways of knowing about the past.^[@thomas_ii_computing_2004.]  Like other historical methods, once you have gained a familiarity with computational history, you will see historical sources in a new way. Let me give an example using some data that I gathered. The Paulist Fathers, an order of Catholic missionary priests, kept a *Chronicle* of their missions across the United States during the nineteenth century.^[*Chronicle of the Missions Given by the Congregation of Missionary Priests of St. Paul the Apostle*, six manuscript volumes, Paulist Fathers Archives, New York, NY.] These six manuscript volumes contain over a thousand pages of narrative recollections and anecdotes about the missions the Paulists preached. Any historian would know what to do with those narrative portions, though some historians might pay attention to social relations, others to the gendered aspects of the missions, and so on. 

At the head of each entry, though, the Paulists recorded statistics of the missions, as in the image below. It would be easy to ignore these statistics, or to mention the numbers for a mission here or a mission there without ever doing anything systematic with them.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The statistics for a Paulist mission held in Washington, DC, in 1889. Note the dates, location, number of confessions, and number of conversions."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paulist-chronicle.jpg")
```

Once transcribed these statistics, though scattered over a thousand pages, made a cohesive table of data, keeping track of the cities in which missions were held, their dates, the number of confessions the Paulists heard, and the number of converts they made. From there the locations mentioned in the Paulist chronicle could be geocoded, so that latitudes and longitudes were associated with place names. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The first few rows of a data table transcribed from the Paulist missions. Note that each piece of significant information from the manuscript record has become its own column in the table."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paulist-table.png")
```

With that table of data, it is possible to create many kinds of visualization. One might, for instance, check the relationship between the duration of the missions and the number of converts the Paulists made, or ask which states had the most converts. After also finding the data for the historic state boundaries and railroad locations, it is possible to create a map like the one below, in order to understand the spatial relationship of Paulist missions.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Redemptorist and Paulist missions from 1852 to 1865. Note that there are three kinds of spatial data in this map: the transcribed missions data with city locations, the historical state boundaries, and the railroad network."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paulist-map.png")
```

In this instance a prior knowledge of computational history let us see our sources differently. Latent in the manuscript *Chronicle* was a table of data. What might have been just a useful collection of anecdotal details *also* became a quantitative and spatial dataset which let us examine the larger patterns of Paulist missions. By multiplying our ways of knowing, we learned more about the Paulists than we otherwise would have. 

Once you are familiar with what you can do with these kinds of historical methods, you will start seeing many sources differently. What once might have been membership lists for different organizations you might come to see as a network graph of the social structure of a community, or a quantitative analysis the gender balance in those organizations. What might seems like a sprawling set of texts might be arranged into a manageable set of topics. The aim of this book is to teach you how to think historically with computational methods.

## What is computational history?



## How this book is organized

Part I of this book aims to teach you how to think as a historian with computational methods. Each chapter is a miniature research project. Beginning with some historical dataset, each chapter demonstrates how to frame a meaningful historical question which can be answered by computation. They then walk you through the process of analyzing the data, visualizing it, asking further historical questions, and so on in an iterative process until you have come to a historical argument or interpretation. These chapters apply the methods explained in part II in order to show how those methods stand in relation to one another.

Part II teaches the methods of computational history themselves. These chapters break down into roughly two categories. Some chapters explain how to work with different types of data. For example, you will need to know how to read in tabular data and spatial data, but you will also need to know how to parse dates and names. Other chapters explain analytical techniques, such as mapping or network analysis. These chapters also point you to more in-depth explanations for further reading.

The appendices contain technical information that you may find useful, such as an explanation of how to install R and its packages and a guide to the package ecosystem in R. In general, this information is included because I have found in teaching that having it available it clears the path for students to focus on more meaningful concerns.
