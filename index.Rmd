description: '"Computational Historical Thinking" is a textbook that teaches you how to identify sources and frame historical questions then answer them through computational methods. These historical methods include exploratory data analysis, mapping, text analysis, and network analysis. These methods are taught using the R programming language, commonly used by digital historians and digital humanists. Chapters on individual methods ground you in particular approaches, and chapters on case studies of historical research walk you through the process of asking and answering computational history questions.'

# About this book {-}

*Computational Historical Thinking* is a textbook that teaches you how to identify sources and frame historical questions then answer them through computational methods. These historical methods include exploratory data analysis, mapping, text analysis, and network analysis. These methods are taught using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), commonly used by digital historians and digital humanists. Chapters on individual methods ground you in particular approaches, and chapters on case studies of historical research walk you through the process of asking and answering computational history questions.
