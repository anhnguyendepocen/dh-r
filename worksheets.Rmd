# Worksheets

The best way to learn R or computational history is to practice. These worksheets contain a series of questions designed to teach you about R or different computational methods. The worksheets are [R Markdown documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) that include text and code together. The places where you are expected to answer questions are marked like this. 

```
(@) There are other datasets in historydata. Can you make a plot from one or more of them?
```

Beneath each question is a space to either create a code block or write an answer.
